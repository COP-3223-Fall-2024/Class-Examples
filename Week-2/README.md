# Introduction to Control Structures in C

## What are Control Structures?

Control structures in C are constructs that dictate the flow of control in a program. They allow you to make decisions, execute code repeatedly, and branch execution paths.

## Types of Control Structures

1. **Conditional Statements**
    - `if`
    - `if-else`
    - `else-if`
    - `switch`
2. **Looping Statements** (covred in a separate doc)
    - `for`
    - `while`
    - `do-while`
3. **Jump Statements**
    - `break`
    - `continue`
    - `return`
    - `goto`
