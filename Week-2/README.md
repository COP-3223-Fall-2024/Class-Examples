# Weekly Summary

## Recap

Last week, we discussed the following:

- development environments
- basic components of a C program
- Styling within programming
- Data Types, Casting, and Compatibility

## This week

For this week, we will be discussing the following:

- Functions
- User input
- Certain C Libraries

### SparkNotes on functions

A function in C is defined with the following components:

1. **Return Type**: The type of value the function returns. If the function does not return a value, the return type is `void`.
2. **Function Name**: The name of the function, used to call it.
3. **Parameters**: A list of variables passed to the function (optional).
4. **Function Body**: The block of code that performs the function's task, enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

### SparkNotes on User input

There are several **functions** used to read user input. Here are some of the common ones below:

- `scanf`
- `fgets`
- `fget`
  
There exists a list of format specifiers which define the type of data to be read.

Addressing is crucial. We will get into more details later when we hit pointers and dynamic memory management but the key note is here:

- address-of operator (&) is used to pass the address of the variable where the input value should be stored.
  - whole strings do **not** require it
