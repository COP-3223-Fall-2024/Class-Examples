# Calculator Functions in C

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will create four different functions that mimic the basic operations of a calculator: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By completing these exercises, you will gain a better understanding of how to write and use functions in C.

## Program Setup

For the file containing your solution, you will name it as `function_exercises.c`.

We will be using two variables as defined at the start of main. What you call those variables is up to you, but refrain from being ___. These values will hold the respective values `10` and `5`

For the order of execution, you will set it up in the following manner:

- Multiply(10, 5) becomes w, thus, w = 50
- Subtract(w, 10) becomes x, thus, x = 40
- Add(w, x) becomes y, thus, y = 90
- Divide(y, 5) becomes z, thus, z = 18

### 1. Addition Function

Create a function named `add` that takes two integers and returns their sum.

### 2. Subtraction Function

Create a function named `subtract` that takes two integers and returns their difference.

### 3. Multiplication Function

Create a function named `multiply` that takes two integers and returns their product.

### 4. Division Function

Create a function named `divide` that takes two integers and returns their quotient as a float.

### 5. Expectation

Steps:

1. Write a function prototype for each task.
2. Define and implement each task.
3. Call each task in the main function and print the result.

Example Output:

```txt
50
40
90
18
```

## Conclusion

By completing these exercises, you have learned how to create functions in C that perform basic arithmetic operations. These foundational skills will be useful as you progress in your programming journey. Continue to practice by creating more complex functions and combining them to build more advanced programs.
