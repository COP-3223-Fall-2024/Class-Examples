# Class Structure

Each week, folders will appear describing the concepts/topics covered. The top level readme will also include a summary of that week's topics and will eventually include references to challenge problems.

## Examples

Since this class is fully online, I do not want to bore you with pptxs. Instead, I'll bore you with the industry standard of documentation. That being markdown files. 

Every folder will contain a more in-depth look into the topic and there will be C files associated with that topic. 

Over time, these will become more advanced and tis the natural progression of y'all learning in this course.

### Contributions

Now this is where it gets interesting. As I mentioned in webcourses, everyone is encouraged to add to this course and provide feedback or even changes they would like to see for future students.

Since this is an intro class, many of you might not know what github is or are afraid to start using, etc. I will link two videos to get started:

As time goes on, I will most definitely forget a few things each week. Better yet, I hope to see y'all making "changes" instead of simply emailing me and saying "this isn't correct" or "I think this is a better example". Github is great because it allows millions of users to contribute to public repositories and see their changes in a live format. 

So I encourage everyone to learn git commands (part of Level 4 in Resources) to start making changes here. Any change you make will undergo a review process by me and the TAs and as a result, if approved, you can see it as soon as 5 minutes of posting your review. Everyone can see and you will not only be helping yourself but everyone around you.
