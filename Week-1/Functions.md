# Writing Functions in C

## Introduction

Functions in C are essential for creating modular, reusable code. This guide will explain how to write functions in C and provide exercises for you to practice creating your own functions.

## Anatomy of a Function

A function in C is defined with the following components:
1. **Return Type**: The type of value the function returns. If the function does not return a value, the return type is `void`.
2. **Function Name**: The name of the function, used to call it.
3. **Parameters**: A list of variables passed to the function (optional).
4. **Function Body**: The block of code that performs the function's task, enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
