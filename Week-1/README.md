# Summary of Functions, Variables, and Data Types in C

## 1. Functions

Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in modular programming by allowing code reuse and better organization.

### Function Declaration

A function must be declared before it is used. The declaration includes the return type, function name, and parameters.

```c
return_type function_name(parameter_list);
```

## 2. Variables

Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated by the program. Each variable has a type, a name, and a value.

### Variable Declaration and Initialization

Variables can be declared and optionally initialized.

## 3. Data Types
Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. Each data type occupies a specific amount of memory.

### Basic Data Types and modifiers

- Used to store integer values. Typically occupies 4 bytes.
- Type modifiers alter the size and range of basic data types.

## Summary

Understanding functions, variables, and data types is fundamental to programming in C. Functions help in code organization and reuse, variables store data for manipulation, and data types define the kind of data a variable can hold. Mastering these concepts will enable you to write efficient and organized C programs.

Happy coding!
