# Assignment: Understanding Static Arrays in C

## Objectives

- Learn how to declare and initialize static arrays.
- Understand how to access and modify array elements.
- Perform common operations on arrays such as summing elements and finding the maximum value.
- Test your understanding through a series of tasks.

## Instructions

Complete the following tasks and submit your solutions in a single `.c` file. Ensure your code is well-commented and follows best practices.

### Task 1: Declaring and Initializing Arrays

1. Declare an array of integers with 5 elements.
2. Initialize the array with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
3. Print the elements of the array.


### Task 2: Accessing and Modifying Array Elements

1. Access the third element of the array and print it.
2. Modify the second element of the array to the value 10.
3. Print the updated array.

### Task 3: Summing Array Elements

1. Write a function sumArray that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters and returns the sum of its elements.
2. In the main function, declare an array of integers and initialize it with some values.
3. Call the sumArray function and print the result.

### Task 4: Finding the Maximum Value

1. Write a function maxArray that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters and returns the maximum value in the array.
2. In the main function, declare an array of integers and initialize it with some values.
3. Call the maxArray function and print the result.

#### Example Output

- Task 1
```sh
Array elements: 1 2 3 4 5
```

- Task 2
```sh
Third element: 3
Updated array elements: 1 10 3 4 5
```

- Task 3
```sh
Sum of array elements: 15
```

- Task 4
```sh
Maximum value in the array: 5
```
