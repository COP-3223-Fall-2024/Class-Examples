### SparkNotes on Conditional Statements

There exists 4 types of conditional statements:

- `if`
- `if-else`
- `else-if`
- `switch`

There is something called `early exit` and `fall-through` situations within `if` and `switch` situations respectively. 

### SparkNotes on Looping

Loops are fundamental in programming, allowing you to execute a block of code multiple times. In C, you have several looping constructs: `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
